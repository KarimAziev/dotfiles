# About

This repository contains configurations and scripts to automate the setup of a new machine or environment on `Ubuntu 22.04`. It includes dotfiles for bash, mpv, viewnior, and several other configurations, alongside an installation script for automating the installation of necessary tools, applications, and utilities.

The setup is divided into two main parts:

1. **Environment Setup Script (`install.sh`)**: Automates the process of installing necessary software and tools, configuring settings, and performing initial system setups like git initialization, command-line utilities, and development tools installation.
2. **Dotfiles Configuration**: Utilizes Makefiles for modular management of configuration files, allowing for easy application, removal, and updating of dotfiles across the system.

## Usage

### Automated Setup with `install.sh`

The `install.sh` script simplifies the installation process, managing tasks like tool and utility installations. It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, and you can execute specific configuration steps selectively.

To start the setup, you can directly execute the script using the following command:

```shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarimAziev/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"
```

For a manually downloaded repository, ensure `install.sh` is executable:

```shell
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

To run in non-interactive mode, bypassing all prompts:

```shell
./install.sh --non-interactive
```

To execute specific steps only, such as `init_git` and `init_nvm`:

```shell
./install.sh init_git init_nvm
```

### Configuring Dotfiles with Make

After setting up the environment, configure your dotfiles using the root `Makefile` to symlink configurations for bash, mpv, viewnior, etc., into their respective locations:

```shell
make install
```

This command links configuration files like `.bashrc`, `mpv.conf`, and others to your `$HOME` directory, ensuring your settings are applied. You can manage configurations individually by specifying the module name, for example:

```shell
make install-bash
make install-mpv
```

To clean up (remove) the configurations, use:

```shell
make clean
```

Or for a specific module:

```shell
make clean-bash
```

# Commands

Here are some commands that the script can execute:

- `init_git`: Install git and configure the default branch.
